Valkyrie Social service thing
===

* Games need to be able to like, register achievement things and xp values with
  them. Sort of like any achievement thing ever.
* Global chat was totally a thing people wanted
* Servers need to be able to inform the server when a player completes an
  achievement
* Needs some API for getting player info

The rest is totally easy because we can think of it as we go along, or I can
just implement it with Roblox's API. Mostly.

Yes.
