		The implementation in this case is simple enough however, and involves
		modifying __index to check if the object is an Instance. This can be cached.
		If the object is an Instance, it can resolve back to the list of overrides
		for the Instance. Notice how there's not one right now? It's because making
		one means that the Instance metatable has to be reapplied every time it
		passes through a wrapper. This is an issue with global wrapper lists, and is
		the reason that the meaning of the constructor argument has been reversed
		for LiteLib. Does this cause issues? Yes. Does it stop excessively messing
		with Instances and unexpected behaviour from modded environments? Yes.

		All evils are evil.
